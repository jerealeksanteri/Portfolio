        <br>I'm a 24-year-old Embedded Systems and Software Engineering, Bachelor's degree student from Tampere, Finland.
        <br>I've always been intriqued about modern technology and programming, and I'm always looking for new skills and better workflows to acquire.
        <br><br>Since I completed my marticulation examination, I've been working my way up from a summer job as a customer service agent to a part time Software Engineer in a stock listed company.
        <br><br>The studies and my time in industry have given me a solid foundation in developing functional and maintainable software, and I'm eager to always learn more.
        <br><br>I've always been intriqued by how things work, from the ground up. That has meant endless online courses and self learning of web development, little game projects, microcontroller programming, backend and middleware development and much more.
